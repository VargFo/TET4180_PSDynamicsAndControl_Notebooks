    "\n",
    "To effectively analyze the Power System it needs to be modeled, which is a balance act between retaining information while simplifying a complex system. First, we look at the swing equation and the relation between electrical and mechanical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The swing equation (chap. 5.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **swing equation** is a fundamental equation in power systems that describes the dynamics of a synchronous machine's rotor. It represents the balance between the mechanical and electrical torques and how they affect the machine's angular position and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classic swing equation:**\n",
    "    $$ J \\frac{d^2\\delta}{dt^2} + D_d \\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\tau_m - \\tau_e $$\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - $ J $: Total moment of inertia\n",
    "    - $ D_d $: Damping coefficient\n",
    "    - $ \\tau_m $: Mechanical torque\n",

    "    - $ \\delta $: Angle\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is derived from Newtons second law of motion as can be seen in the lecture slides. A particulary important relation which is utlized is the relation between rotational speed, or frequency, and the angle. The rotational speed can be expressed as \n",
    "$$\n",

    "## Equilibrium points (synchronising power/torque) (chap. 5.3)\n",
    "Section 5.1 shows that the accelerating power depends on the difference between turbine power $P_m$ and electrical air-gap power $P_e$ (minus damping power $P_D$). Mechanical power is controlled by the turbine governor, while electrical air-gap power depends on generator loading, parameters, and power angle. In this section, we consider only the steady-state model of the generator-infinite busbar system, with the infinite busbar voltage $V_s$ as the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In steady state, the generator is represented by a constant emf $E_q$ behind synchronous reactances $X_d$ and $X_q$. Neglecting resistances and shunt admittances, the air-gap power $P_e$ equals the power delivered to the system $P_s$ and is given by :\n",

    "in a salient pole generator. $x_d = X_d + X$, $x_q = X_q + X$, and $X = X_T + X_s$ is the combined reactance of the step-up transformer and equivalent network. The angle $\\delta$ is the angle between $E_q$ and $V_s$ phasors (power angle) and the spatial angle between the generator rotor and the fictitious system generator (rotor angle). This links the swing equation with the electrical state of the generator. For constant $E_q$ and $V_s$, the power-angle characteristic $P_e = P_e(\\delta)$ allows rewriting the swing equation.\n",

    "# Bode Plot Analysis - Frequency Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Bode plots are a fundamental tool in control and power system analysis used to assess the frequency response of a linear system. In the context of small-signal stability, they help visualize how the system responds to disturbances at different frequencies. The magnitude plot shows the system gain across frequencies, while the phase plot reveals phase shifts that indicate potential instability. By analyzing the gain and phase margins, we can determine how robust the system is to perturbations and how close it is to instability. This makes Bode plots particularly useful in evaluating the dynamic behavior of power system components and controllers.\n",
