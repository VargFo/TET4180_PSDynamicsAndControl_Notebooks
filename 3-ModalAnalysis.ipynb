If $ \\alpha_i < 0 $ then the corresponding oscillatory mode is stable. If $ \\alpha_i > 0 $ then the corresponding oscillatory mode is unstable. The term $ \\Omega_i $ is the frequency of oscillation (in rad/s) of the oscillatory mode. The angle $ \\phi_{ki} $ is the phase angle of the oscillatory mode and its value depends on the initial conditions.\n",

    "3. The solution $ x_k(t) $ of a differential equation is a linear combination of the modes and the coefficients of proportionality in that combination depend on the initial conditions. As an oscillatory mode corresponds to a response of a second-order underdamped system while an aperiodic mode corresponds to a response of a first-order system, effectively a small-signal response of a dynamic system of high order is represented as a linear combination of responses of decoupled second- and first-order systems.\n",

Since the frequency of the mode is **0.50 Hz**, it is an **inter-area mode**. This means that generators from different areas in the power system could swing against each other. From the mode shape of **Mode \\( k \\)**, we can clearly see that **Generator 3 swings against Generators 1 and 2**, and this behavior is reflected in the speed response as **Generator 3 swings against Generators 1 and 2 throughout the plot**. These **oscillations** decay slowly because the mode is **very poorly damped**!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mode \\( l \\)**, with a frequency of **1.50 Hz** and good damping (**10.56%**), is a **local mode** and is well damped. From the mode shape plot, we can see that the **phasor representing Generator 1 has a much higher amplitude compared to the phasors of Generators 3 and 2**. This means that the mode is much more visible in **Generator 1**. This is evident in the speed plot just after the disturbance, where **Generator 1 exhibits some non-sinusoidal waves**. However, after **2.2 seconds**, the sine wave of **Generator 1** returns to normal. This happens because the mode causing these **unusual oscillations** is **quickly damped**.\n",

    "Mode shapes can only be used to compare state variables of the same type. For example, to understand how different generators swing against each other, we analyze the magnitudes and angles of the phasors in the mode shape plot. These phasors indicate how much each generator is influenced by the mode in response to a perturbation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we had three generators, and their mode shape phasors showed the relative impact of the mode on each generator. However, if we were to compare generator speed responses to rotor angles, the phasor scaling would be incorrect. This is because mode shapes describe relative influence only within the same type of state variable. Mixing different types of variables (e.g., speed vs. angle) would lead to misleading interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This leaves us the question: how to compare how much a given mode will influence different types of state variables? \n",
    "The solution is participation factors! These provide a way to measure how much a given mode influences different state variables, even if they are of different types. This will be introduced in lectures and in another notebook!\n",
